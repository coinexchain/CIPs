0004 | Change the feature fee for issuing new tokens and the length limit of tokens | | Draft |



## Abstract

This CIP describe the changes for calculating feature fees when issuing new tokens.



## Motivation

Reduce the feature fees for issuing tokens, especially long tokens, such that CoinEx DEX can support more use cases.



## Changes in token length

- Extend the length of tokens to 2~16.
- Old rule: `^[a-z][a-z0-9]{1,7}(\\.[a-z])?$`

- New rule: `^[a-z][a-z0-9]{1,13}([a-z0-9]{1,2}|(\.[a-z]))?$`

    Following tokens are valid:

    ```
    ab
    abc
    usdh
    ht.t               // A token ending with .[a-z] can only be issued by CET Owner
    usdt.t             // A token ending with .[a-z] can only be issued by CET Owner
    usdt.x             // A token ending with .[a-z] can only be issued by CET Owner
    a1234567890123.t   // A token ending with .[a-z] can only be issued by CET Owner
    a123456789012345
    abcdefx20191129
    abcdef20191129
    ```

    Following tokens are invalid:
    ```
    00                    // Can not start with digit
    0aa                   // Can not start with digit
    a.b                   // There should be at least two characters before dot
    a1234567890123456     // The length is larger than 16
    a12345678901234.t     // The length is larger than 16
    a123456789012345.t    // The length is larger than 16
    ```

- Underlying constraint: cosmos-sdk limits the token length to 16: `[a-z][a-z0-9]{2,15}`



## Feature Fees according to Token Symbol Length

| Parameter Name  | Meaning                | Value   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| IssueRareTokenFee    | Feature fee for issuing a token with length=2 | 10_0000CET |
| Issue3CharTokenFee   | Feature fee for issuing a token with length=3 | 1_0000CET  |
| Issue4CharTokenFee   | Feature fee for issuing a token with length=4 | 5000CET    |
| Issue5CharTokenFee   | Feature fee for issuing a token with length=5 | 2000CET    |
| Issue6CharTokenFee   | Feature fee for issuing a token with length=6 | 1000CET    |
| IssueNonRareTokenFee | Feature fee for issuing a token with length>=7 | 500CET     |



## Update Requirement

- The related parameters should be added to the generated genesis.json file
