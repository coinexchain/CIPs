0003 | Change the rules for modifying token's attribute to make it easier to transfer token's ownership | | Draft |

## Abstract

This CIP describes the scenarios in which the token's attribute can be modified.



## Motivation

To make the ownership tranferring more smooth, we need to allow token owners modify the tokens attributes, such that the attributes can be more suitable for the new scenarios after transferring.



## Rules

- The precondition for attribute modification is tokens are not dispersed. Tokens can be dispersed in following ways.
    - send and multisend
    - trade in normal market
    - trade in bancor market

- The tokens of an asset is not dispersed if and only if:
  
  - All the tokens are owned by the token owner
  
- When the tokens are not dispersed, the attributes can be adjusted any time, without any limitation in change frequency or change times.

- When the tokens are dispersed, the following attributes can only be changed in one direction (the direction in which the token owner has less power):
    - `Mintable`, `AddrForbiddable`, `TokenForbiddable`: change from true to false
    - `Burnable`: Change from false to true

- 创建Token时属性列表如下:

    | 属性               | 类型            | 是否可修改 | 含义      |
    | ------------------ | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
    | `Symbol`           | string         | ❌Can not be changed | token symbol |
    | `Owner`            | sdk.AccAddress | Can be changed through a ownership transferring transaction | The initial issuer of this token |
    | `Name`             | string         | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed | Name of the newly issued asset |
    | `TotalSupply`      | sdk.Int        | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed | The total supply for this token |
    | `Mintable`         | bool           | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed<br>Can only changed from false to true after dispersion | Whether this token could be <br>minted after the issuing |
    | `Burnable`         | bool           | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed<br>Can only changed from false to true after dispersion | Whether this token could be burned |
    | `AddrForbiddable`  | bool           | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed<br>Can only changed from false to true after dispersion | whether could forbid some addresses<br> to forbid transaction |
    | `TokenForbiddable` | bool           | Can be changed when tokens are not dispersed<br>Can only changed from false to true after dispersion | whether token could be global forbid |
    | `URL`              | string         |✅Can always be changed | URL of token website |
    | `Description`      | string         |✅Can always be changed | Description of token info |
    | `Identity`         | string         |✅Can always be changed | Identity of token |



## Implementation

- When tokens are not dispersed, the token owner can use a "Token Issue Transaction" to change the attributes of an existing asset.
- `Mintable`: When it changed from true to false, `TotalMint` will be reset to 0
- `Burnable`: When it changed from true to false, `TotalBurn` will be reset to 0
- `AddrForbiddable`: When it changed from true to false, `Blacklist` will be reset to empty
- `TokenForbiddable`: When it changed from true to false, `IsForbidden` will be reset to false



### Update Requirement

- Do not need to modify the generated genesis.json file
