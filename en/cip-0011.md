| 0011 | Push the block rewards for validators and delegators to Trade-Server |        | Draft |

## Abstract

Trade-Server need to analyze and publish the block rewards information, so these information must be pushed to Trade-Server from `cetd`.

## Background

In the distribution module of Cosmos-SDK, the BeginBlocker invokes the AllocateTokens function (defined in distribution/keeper/allocation.go) to distribute block rewards to the proposer of last block, voting validators and their delegators. And currently the amounts of these rewards are not sent to Kafka.

## Motivation

Trade-Server need reward information to calculate an expected rate of return of indivdual validator.

## Changes
In the distribution module of Cosmos-SDK, there are two events are generated to describe the validator's reward and delegator's reward. They can be translated to Kafka messages sent to Trade-Server.
