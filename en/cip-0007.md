0007|Change the removal rule for GTE orders| | Draft 

## Background

In centralized exchanges, users can remove her orders after creation, if she think the order's price is no longer suitable.

CoinEx DEX Chain supports same function. And it supports a special GTE (good till expire) order, which allows users to specify the life time of orders, in block count. When the specified life time is reached and the order is not fully matched, then it will be removed from chain automatically. The deletion of GTE orders is performed at UTC midnight, in a batched scheme.

## Motivation

For `coinex-dex v0.1.0`, the automatical deletion of GTE orders need two preconditions:

1. Its the first block after UTC midnight
2. The order has been stored on chain for 100000(`gte_order_lifetime`) blocks
   That is: the chain allows an order to be stored 100000(`gte_order_lifetime`) for blocks for free. So when automatically deleting the GTE orders, only the orders which is at least 100000 blocks old are examined. Any orders which is younger than that, will not be deleted.

This CIP proposes to remove the above precondition #2. So all the GTE orders will be examined as deletion candidate at UTC midnight.

## Rule Change

For `coinex-dex v0.1.0`, the rule for deleting GTE orders are:

*   ~~Examine the orders which were create at least 100000 blocks before~~

The rule proposed by this CIPï¼š

*   **Examine all the GTE orders for deletion**
