| 0009 | Exchange recharge addresses can not be used for delegator reward withdraw. |        | Implemented in Dex2 |

## Abastract

Exchange recharge address can not be used in MsgSetWithdrawAddress transactions (which set address for delegator reward withdraw)

## Background

To prevent user to forget fill the memo during recharge to centralized exchanges, CoinEx Chain supports a feature: an address can have a `require-memo` attribute, and when its attribute is true, you can not transfer tokens into this addresses without filling the memo.

But if a user set an address with `require-memo=true` as her withdraw address for delegation rewards, the rewards can be transferred to this address during withdrawing, without filling the memo. Such cases need manual treatment, which is a burden for the centralized exchanges.

This CIP will remedy this defect.

## Motivation

If exchange recharge address can not be used in MsgSetWithdrawAddress transactions, then no reward can be sent to this address by users without filling memo.

## Change Rules
When processing`MsgSetWithdrawAddress`, if the `WithdrawAddress` has its `require-memo` attribute to true, then this transaction fails.

```
// msg struct for changing the withdraw address for a delegator (or validator self-delegation)
type MsgSetWithdrawAddress struct {
	DelegatorAddress sdk.AccAddress
	WithdrawAddress  sdk.AccAddress
}

```
