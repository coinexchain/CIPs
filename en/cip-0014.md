| 0014 | How to use wallet Apps as IM with encrypted messages |        | Draft  |

## Overview

All the transactions on CoinEx Chain can be attached with a memo. A memo can be any byte string. 

Any two accounts can send messages to each other by embedding the message into memo. For example, if account A is the owner of some token or some alias, and account B want to negotiate with account A about transferring the ownership to B, then account B can reach to A by sending some coins to A and embedded messages in memo.

However, as the block chains are public, the messages can be seen by anyone. The messages need to be encrypted for privacy.

## Background

The accounts on CoinEx Chain have their public key cached on chain and have their private key store in a wallet. The ECDH algorithm can allow account A and B to generate the same key for symmetrical encryption, and use this key for communication.

In the libsecp256k1 library developed by Bitcoin core, there is a secp256k1_ecdh function, which can generate the same 256-bit integer X using the public key of A and the private key of B, or using the private key of A and the public key of B.

## Motivation

This CIP specifies how to encrypt and decrypt the byte string in memo, using the 256-bit integer X generated from ECDH algorithm.

## Specification

The plaintext to be sent in memo, should be entrypted with AES256-GCM algorithm. The key used for encryption must have 32 bytes, which comes from the mentioned 256-bit X, in little endian byte order. The encrypted text will be sent with transactions in the memo field.

The concrete implementation of the encryption and decryption, should have the same behavior as the following golang code:

```go
// AesGcmEncrypt takes an encryption key and a plaintext string and encrypts it with AES256 in GCM mode, 
// which provides authenticated encryption. Returns the ciphertext and the used nonce.
// len(key) must be 32, to select AES256
func AesGcmEncrypt(key []byte, plaintext string) (ciphertext, nonce []byte) {
	plaintextBytes := []byte(plaintext)

	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	// Never use more than 2^32 random nonces with a given key because of the risk of a repeat.
	nonce = make([]byte, 12)
	if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, nonce); err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	aesgcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	ciphertext = aesgcm.Seal(nil, nonce, plaintextBytes, nil)
	fmt.Printf("Ciphertext: %x\n", ciphertext)
	fmt.Printf("Nonce: %x\n", nonce)

	return
}

// AesGcmDecrypt takes an decryption key, a ciphertext and the corresponding nonce, 
// and decrypts it with AES256 in GCM mode. Returns the plaintext string.
// len(key) must be 32, to select AES256
func AesGcmDecrypt(key, ciphertext, nonce []byte) (plaintext string) {
	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	aesgcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	plaintextBytes, err := aesgcm.Open(nil, nonce, ciphertext, nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	plaintext = string(plaintextBytes)
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", plaintext)

	return
}
```
